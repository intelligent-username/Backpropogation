## Motivation

Imagine we're trying to solve the same old machine learning problem: fitting a model to data. In real life, this data is often complicated and convoluted. [Regression models](https://www.github.com/intelligent-username/polynomial-regression) are often not enough. We start to create more sophisticated models by nesting multiple functions together. Or, we may want to work on classification (i.e. binning labels based on features). Now, these functions, too, need to be optimized. Once again, to do this, we minimize the loss function. We turn to our trusty old [gradient descent](https://www.github.com/intelligent-username/gradient-descent). However, this is computationally expensive, so we need..

## Mathematical Foundation & Theory

This section will cover the complete mathematical derivation and implementation details of backpropagation.

### Neural Network Basics

Forward pass eq'ns and network architecture fundamentals.

### Algorithm

Step-by-step mathematical derivation of the backpropagation process.

### Weight Updates
