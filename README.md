## Motivation

Imagine we're trying to solve the same old machine learning problem: fitting a model to data. In real life, this data is often complicated and convoluted. [Regression models](https://www.github.com/intelligent-username/polynomial-regression) are often not enough. We start to create more sophisticated models by nesting multiple functions together. Or, we may want to work on classification (i.e. binning labels based on features). Now, these functions, too, need to be optimized. Once again, to do this, we minimize the loss function. We turn to our trusty old [gradient descent](https://www.github.com/intelligent-username/gradient-descent). However, this is computationally expensive, so we need..

## Mathematical Foundation & Theory

This section will cover the complete mathematical derivation and implementation details of backpropagation.

### Neural Network Basics

- Forward pass equations chaining inputs through multiple layers, each with weights and biases.
- Network architecture fundamentals: neurons connected in layers, from input to output.
- Activation functions adding non-linearity, like sigmoid or ReLU, to handle complex patterns.
- Loss functions measuring how far predictions are from actual targets, guiding optimization.

### Algorithm

- Step-by-step backpropagation: computing gradients layer by layer, starting from output.
- Chain rule in action: multiplying partial derivatives backwards through the network.
- Error signals flowing reverse, updating each weight based on its contribution to the loss.
- Computational graph unfolding, tracking how each parameter affects the final output.

### Weight Updates

- Gradient descent minimizing loss by adjusting weights in the opposite direction of gradients.
- Learning rate controlling step size, too big overshoots, too small takes forever.
- Optimization techniques like momentum or Adam speeding up convergence.
- Batch vs stochastic: processing all data at once or one sample at a time for efficiency.
