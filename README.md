## Motivation

In real life, regression models are often not enough. Linear regression may be inaccurate and polynomial regression may overfit. More sophisticated tools are needed. Neural networks are one of the tools we use in covering more complex cases. Backpropagation is the key algorithm behind neural networks. Once we have this idea down, we can explore deep learning, which opens up a whole new field of problems to study.

## Mathematical Foundation & Theory

This section will cover the complete mathematical derivation and implementation details of backpropagation.

### Neural Network Basics

Forward pass eq'ns and network architecture fundamentals.

### Algorithm

Step-by-step mathematical derivation of the backpropagation process.

### Weight Updates

Gradient descent and optimization techniques for parameter updates.
